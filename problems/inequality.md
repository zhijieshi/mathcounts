# Inequality Questions

## Set 1

Assume $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. $a > 0$, $b > 0$, and $ab = 1$.

### Q1 
Prove the following inequality.
$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+a}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+b}} \leq \sqrt{2} $$

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Square the left hand side and then apply AM-GM on the term that has square root. 
  The two numbers are $a$ and 1.

### Q2 
Prove the following inequality.
$$ \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{(a+1)(a+2)}} \leq \sqrt{2} - 1 $$

<details>
  <summary>Hint</summary>
  Work on the LHS.
  Focus on the inside of the sqaure root. Transform to the following first.
  $$ (\frac{1}{\sqrt{a+1}} + 1 - 1)\frac{a}{\sqrt{a+2}} + 1 - 1) $$
  Apply AM-GM on the two terms that have $a$.
