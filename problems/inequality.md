# Inequality Questions

## Set 1

Assume $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. $a > 0$, $b > 0$, and $ab = 1$.

### Q1 
Prove the following inequality.

$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+a}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+b}} \leq \sqrt{2} $$

### Q2 
Prove the following inequality.

$$ \frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{(a+1)(a+2)}} \leq \sqrt{2} - 1 $$

### Q3 
Prove the following inequality.

$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+a}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+2b}} \leq 2\sqrt{\sqrt{2}-1} $$

### Q4
Prove the following inequality.

$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+a}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+3b}} \leq \sqrt{2(\sqrt{3}-1)} $$

### Q5
Prove the following inequality.

$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+a}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+4b}} \leq \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}} $$

### Q6
Prove the following inequality.

$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+a}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+kb}} \leq \sqrt{\frac{k}{k-1}} $$

where $k \geq 4 $.

## Set 1 Hints

### Q1 

Square the left hand side and then apply AM-GM on the term that has square root. 
The two numbers are $a$ and 1.

### Q2

Work on the LHS. Focus on the inside of the sqaure root. Transform to the following first.

$$ (\frac{1}{\sqrt{a+1}} + 1 - 1)(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{a+2}} + 1 - 1) $$

Apply AM-GM on the two terms that have $a$.

### Q3

Solve Q2 first.
